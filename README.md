This project deals with the Finger Spelling Kinect 2011 Dataset. Which contains pictures of the standard American Sign Language depicting the English Alphabets.

The Dataset structure is as follows - 
- 5 Main Directories (A,B,C,D,E)
- Each Main Directory contains 24 Sub Directories symbolising the 24 Letters* of the English Alphabet.

* The letters J and Z are excluded from the dataset since they are expressed as moving gestures and not static gestures.
